One of the most important skills you'll need as a Visual Effects Artists is a [[MacGyver]] mentality. The creative spirit where you pull out your metaphorical Swiss Army knife and piece together ideas and techniques that will get the shot FINALED!!

Compositing is NOT a step-by-step art. It's a series of problems and puzzles that come one right after the other, on your way to the finish line.

Yes, there are definitely situations for [[Templates]], but even the most well thought out system of nodes can't take EVERY possible scenario into account, and sooner or later you'll be required to tweak the template to get your Final.

For moments like that you'll need to work that problem solving muscle schools seem to miss out on, where they are more focused in helping students learn how to pass an exam, rather than learn how to think their way through a problem.

Creatively is about going outside the expected bounds of the rules. It's about exploring ideas. It's about seeing the world in a slightly different way that gives you a unique outlook. And most of all, it's about PLAYING!!

Don't be afraid to PLAY!
