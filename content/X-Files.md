title: X-Files Driving References

These days many car sequences are shot on green screens, and while that makes for a much easier production, there is something about them that just never quite feels right to me. Such as the lack of interaction with the world just outside their window.

I love using The X-Files for Car Comp references because they actually shot it for REAL. And because damn near every episode has one or two sequences where Mulder and Scully are heading towards the unexplained.

Here's a clip from the Pilot episode:

The amount of light that comes into the car changes as the sun goes behind the trees. Not only do their entire bodies go into shadows but the bits that get hit by the sun, like Scully's file, look especially nice.

Notice how the reflection by Scully's window goes dark when in the shadows.

Reflections in the front windshield go upward in a curved direction that follows the shape of the glass. It also goes across the entire windshield. Sometimes we cheat the reflection away to make sure we can see the talents face, but many times it feels masked off on purpose.

Here we get the best of both worlds. Thanks to a good camera angle were we get Scully's face through the reflections.

The main light source is on the left side. We can tell by the way Scully is lit up and from the natural light off camera. This bloom of light is a lovely little detail our brains can FEEL and tell us that something we're looking at is REAL.

Compare this to the previous image and see how there is less direct sunlight on Scully due to the trees blocking the sun light from hitting her.

Another example of light changing. This time from a beautiful bloom right into a shadow.

The shadowed interior fits the somber atmosphere outside.

Reflections once again moving in an upward, curved direction, with some beautiful light cutting through the trees.

Check out the light on Mulder's face as it goes from light to shadow. It's a tiny detail you probably wouldn't even notice but these little things are the elements that make up our reality.
