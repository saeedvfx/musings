Short answer: From your noggin!

Your brain is a collection of thoughts and ideas just running around like wild children in the playground. It's absolute chaos from afar, but each child is an important nugget of information you picked up along this crazy ride called life.

A quote from a book you read. 
A snippet from an article. 
A cool moment from a movie that resonate it's you.

It's all up there running around in your brain. 

==The problem is recall.== Your brain is the ultimate gatekeeper and loves keeping information from you. Especially information you kinda need right now!

And what's worse, is the harder you try to retrieve it, the more your brains locks up, and the less your ideas can move around.

There's only one way to retrieve the information: You gotta distract your brain long enough for the information to come rushing towards you.

When do your best ideas happen? 
- In the shower. 
- While going outside for a walk. 
- While laying on the couch and staring at the ceiling. 
- Doodling naughty human parts into your notebook. 
- For me; I've been known to walk around the office and solve my Rubik's cube over and over again in a trance-like state. 

All these activities distract your brain in a way which allows the information to flow around more freely. Eventually one of those children will break free and bestow that EUREKA moment.
