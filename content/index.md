A collection of thoughts and ideas related to Films, Visual Effects, and Film Making in general.

This is NOT a tutorial sites, although some Compositing techniques will be discussed here and there. This is more of a repository of the things I find useful or interesting in all aspects of Film, with a heavy emphasis on VFX.
