Hi there!

This is my Digital Garden of ideas, thoughts, and reflections on Films, Visual Effects, and Film Making in general.

This is NOT a tutorial sites, although some Compositing techniques will be discussed here and there. This is more of a repository of the ideas and theories I've collected along the way.

I believe that Films are important, and Visual Effects are an important part of this medium. In order to be good at one, you need to understand the other.
